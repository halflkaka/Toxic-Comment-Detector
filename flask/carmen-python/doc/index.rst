Carmen documentation
====================

Carmen is a library for geolocating tweets.
Given a tweet, Carmen will return :py:class:`.Location` objects
that represent a physical location.
Carmen uses both coordinates and other information in a tweet to make
geolocation decisions.
It's not perfect, but this greatly increases the number of geolocated
tweets over what Twitter provides.
